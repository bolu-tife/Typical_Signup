<!-- 
    ell designed UI and UX can reduce sign-in form abandonment:

Don't make users hunt for sign-in! Put a link to the sign-in form at the top of the page, using well-understood wording such as Sign In, Create Account or Register.
Keep it focused! Sign-up forms are not the place to distract people with offers and other site features.
Minimize sign-up complexity. Collect other user data (such as addresses or credit card details) only when users see a clear benefit from providing that data.
Before users start on your sign-up form, make it clear what the value proposition is. How do they benefit from signing in? Give users concrete incentives to complete sign-up.
If possible allow users to identify themselves with a mobile phone number instead of an email address, since some users may not use email.
Make it easy for users to reset their password, and make the Forgot your password? link obvious.
Link to your terms of service and privacy policy documents: make it clear to users from the start how you safeguard their data.
Include the logo and name of your company or organization on your signup and sign-in pages, and make sure that language, fonts and styles match the rest of your site. Some forms don't feel like they belong to the same site as other content, especially if they have a significantly different URL.
